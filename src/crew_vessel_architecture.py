"""
Crew Vessel Architecture Implementation Stub

This module defines the architecture for a multi-crew interstellar vessel supporting â‰¤100 personnel, 30-day endurance, and optimized crew operations. It integrates life support, emergency evacuation, crew quarters, and command/control systems as per the technical roadmap and future-directions.md.
