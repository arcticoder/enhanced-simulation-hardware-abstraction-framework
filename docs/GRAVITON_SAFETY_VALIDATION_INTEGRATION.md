        # Validate positive energy constraint
        energy_density = self.compute_stress_energy_tensor(graviton_field_state)
        positive_energy_check = np.all(energy_density.eigenvalues >= 0)
        
        # Assess biological exposure
        biological_exposure = self.continuous_monitoring.assess_exposure(graviton_field_state)
        safety_factor = self.safety_margin / biological_exposure
        
        # Emergency response if safety compromised
        if not positive_energy_check or safety_factor < self.safety_margin:
