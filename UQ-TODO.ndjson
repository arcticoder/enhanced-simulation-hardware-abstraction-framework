{"title": "Digital Twin 20D State Space Correlation Validation", "description": "The expanded 20×20 correlation matrix lacks rigorous mathematical validation. Cross-block correlations (0.3× base strength) are heuristic without theoretical justification, potentially leading to unrealistic state correlations.", "type": "theoretical", "severity": 70, "category": "correlation_modeling", "impact": "May generate non-physical correlations leading to incorrect uncertainty estimates"}
{"title": "Vacuum Enhancement Force Calculation Oversimplification", "description": "The vacuum enhancement calculation uses simplified 1D Casimir force models and arbitrary parameter values (1μm separation, 1e6 m/s² acceleration). These approximations may not represent realistic experimental conditions.", "type": "theoretical", "severity": 75, "category": "force_modeling", "impact": "May provide incorrect force enhancement predictions for practical applications"}
{"title": "Hardware-in-the-Loop Synchronization Uncertainty", "description": "The HIL overlap integral uses fixed synchronization delay (τ_sync = 1e-6) without accounting for timing jitter, processing delays, or communication latency uncertainties that affect real-time system performance.", "type": "systematic", "severity": 75, "category": "synchronization_uncertainty", "impact": "Could lead to synchronization failures in real-time applications"}
